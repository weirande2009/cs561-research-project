1. We record 6 compactions, but in LOG, the sixth compaction only has
   compacting and there is no compacted.
2. There is only about 4 files in L1 when compaction is triggered.
3. There is still some randomness in the process. In our experiments, when 
   the 7th compaction sometimes happens and sometimes not.
4. Before every enumeration, we should clear files_by_compaction_pri. Can we?
5. In the first record of WA, we find that the bytes number of bytes_read_non_output_levels
   is greater than bytes_written_all.
6. Now we can only record WA after each compaction but can't record the total written bytes

# 3. The files in L1 is different when the first compaction is triggered

1. We record 6 compactions, but in LOG, the sixth compaction only has
   compacting and there is no compacted.
2. There is only about 4 files in L1 when compaction is triggered.
3. There is still some randomness in the process. In our experiments, when 
   the 7th compaction sometimes happens and sometimes not.
4. Before every enumeration, we should clear files_by_compaction_pri. Can we?


# 3. The files in L1 is different when the first compaction is triggered

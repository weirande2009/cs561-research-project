5/26:
1. write a shell script that enables running multiple workloads 
at the same time. (finished in 6/3)
2. write a shell script and modify current program to make 
the write amplification of the optimal one and two baseline
algorithms collectable for the next step work.
Save the write amplification to a file for further analysis10fen
3. write a shell script and modify current program to make
any run for a workload replayable.

6/24:
1. modify the current scripts to make the experiment run in a single "docker"
2. run larger workloads for more information
